# basic description

scripts running on a regulary basis as cron job to check for new Posts and then re-posting
them in Diaspora*
This skript only is interim solution until Diaspora will have true group functionality.

# actual Status

not deployed - not suitable to use - warning

# requirements

ability to do *sql*querys in the Database, to use *curl* , *cron* and run basic *shell*-scripts. 
if you run your own Pod, chances are good that these is all true. This only have to be true for 
the Pod/Server where the Group is running on, all contributing users do not need a specialised 
software or pod.
If you think you can do it, you can try to run a pod for the purpose of having group users

# backup warning

please, if your Pod differ in any Way (like no Mysql, no Debian 7, no whatever), or your just 
testing *make a Backup beforehand.*

# preperation

-  download scriptfile, i would suggest to use 	
   cd /home/diaspora
   git clone https://github.com/viisauksena/diasp_group.git
-  open a fresh new acount on your desired Pod (see requirements). 
   This user will work as the group. Create the user, login, 
   and *disable first steps* in settings and *enable autoconnect* if you are connected. 
   You don't have to use the autoconnect if you want to have more control of your Members in the Group.
   Everybody which you are sharing with will get the posts of the other Members re-posted.
-  We need a valid cookie_session and a valid csrf token 
   (yeah, its somehow like basic bad hacking works) of the new user.
   The CSRF Token can be found while you are logged in as this new user in the source of your loaded Page,
   around line 50 or so, search for 
   <meta content="authenticity_token" name="csrf-param">
   <meta content="uoahsomesuperWe3rdT0kenchunkcCNcnhk=" name="csrf-token">
   The Session key is saved in a Cookie, we need the _diaspora_session for this, you have to save this also.
   Somehow good to write it directly in config file or collect it in a extra-textfile.
-  delete the session Cookie without logging out ! 
   (in my case this lets the cookie be valid, as long as it is not automated this buggy behaviour is
    very usefull for us)
[Todo - maybe we can automate this like the _session_key alreay done] 
[Todo - get the author id of new user - some strange number]
-  copy config.example to config 	
   cp config.example config 
   and adjust the settings with any texteditor you like

# before cron jobbing
-  connect with your normal account with new group-user, 
   we suggest to use an extra group-aspect for that, or at least be aware of the 
   consequences of where you put your group account into. Every post you share with 
   an aspect which belongs to the group-user, the groupuser will multiply it to all 
   groupmembers. We just mention this, because some people didnt get the functionality 
   of aspects yet. If the groupuser do autoconnect he already has you reconnected, 
   otherwise you have to do this manualy now
-  basic testing: make a post non-public to this new group-aspect with your normal account
-  because we dont have any cronjob yet nothing more will happen, we now try if the script 
   works manually, go to the script folder and run repost.sh and than check diaspora website 
   if the post is re-posted, you probably will get no output at the shell at all. If you get
   some errors - ohOh - you have to go through them, basicly it means something gone wrong.
-  if everything works fine you use crontab -e and for running this script every minute  
   use a line like this, for any other repeating - watch for *crontab faq*
   crontab -e
   * * * * * /home/diaspora/diasp_group/getall.sh

# your done
the script should check regulary for new posts and repost them,  
deleted posts will be found nearby as regular (so that takes mabe some minutes),
you will see your own post double - you can do nothing about that.

have fun - enjoy
