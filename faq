Basic Idea

Basic Idea comes from this Issue on original Diaspora Code 0.4something https://github.com/viisauksena/diasp_group.git , after that there was many attemps to get more knowledge of Code and to come in contact with Developers - to at least get some basic questions answered.
While many people strongly like this idea it was quite hard to get into meaningfull discussions with the people who really make the Diaspora* Code .. at least over several weeks when i was heavily interested. 
I got some friends around and we reverse engineer the Code and functionality as far as we could understand it. We are normal average people, maybe with a strong vision, and a really lack of Ruby-coding.
